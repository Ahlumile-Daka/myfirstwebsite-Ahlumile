        <h2>Escalation Procedure Overview</h2>
        <p>If you encounter an issue that cannot be resolved through standard troubleshooting, please follow the escalation procedure below. This will help ensure that your issue receives the necessary attention at each level of support.</p>

        <!-- Escalation Levels -->
        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h3>Level 1: Initial Support</h3>
            <p><strong>Step:</strong> Start by reaching out to our general support team via the <a href="contact.html">Contact Page</a> or <a href="request-form.html">Request Form</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Actions:</strong> Provide detailed information about the issue, including any error messages, recent changes, and troubleshooting steps you've attempted. Our support team will try to resolve the issue directly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h3>Level 2: Advanced Support</h3>
            <p><strong>Criteria:</strong> If the issue remains unresolved or is of medium priority, it will be escalated to a more specialized support technician.</p>
            <p><strong>Actions:</strong> A support technician will review your case in detail. You may be asked to provide additional information, such as system logs or screenshots, to assist in diagnosing the issue.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h3>Level 3: Expert Support</h3>
            <p><strong>Criteria:</strong> For high-priority or complex issues that cannot be resolved at Level 2, the case is escalated to our expert technical team.</p>
            <p><strong>Actions:</strong> The expert team will conduct a thorough investigation and may perform remote diagnostics if needed. You will be regularly updated on the progress and estimated resolution time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h3>Level 4: Management Escalation</h3>
            <p><strong>Criteria:</strong> If an issue is critical or impacts multiple users and cannot be resolved by the expert team, it will be escalated to senior management.</p>
            <p><strong>Actions:</strong> Senior management will prioritize the issue and work directly with the tech team to expedite a resolution. This level includes cases with company-wide impact or those with compliance concerns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h3>Level 5: External Escalation</h3>
            <p><strong>Criteria:</strong> If the issue requires assistance from external vendors or third-party services, it will be escalated externally.</p>
            <p><strong>Actions:</strong> Our team will coordinate with external partners, keeping you informed throughout the process. This level may take additional time, depending on the response times of third-party providers.</p>
